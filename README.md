# Career Satisfaction Insights

A project for Chapter 1 of Udacity's course.


## Motivation

This project was created to assist with the submission of chapter 1 of “Data Science” Udacity course.


## Summary of results

* Working in a company whose size is 100-999 employees would provide the highest career satisfaction.
* Working in a publicly-traded corporation would result in possibly feeling underpaid or just right.
* The career satisfaction is correlated with the job satisfaction but not salary and hours worked per week.
